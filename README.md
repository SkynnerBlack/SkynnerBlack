### ⚙️ Serverless Data Pipeline with Intelligent Retry & Clustering (AWS)

Designed and implemented a **fully serverless, event-driven data pipeline on AWS** focused on:
- Data gap detection
- Automated reprocessing
- Cost optimization
- Professional-grade testability

**Architecture highlights:**
- **AWS Lambda + Amazon SQS + DynamoDB**
- **Single-Table Design** with composite keys
- Continuous **date-stream clustering** to optimize external API calls
- **BatchWrite (25 items)** to maximize DynamoDB throughput
- Fully decoupled **Orchestrator → Worker** pattern

**Engineering practices:**
- Dependency Injection
- Mocking with `pytest` and `unittest.mock`
- Isolated unit tests without real AWS usage
- IAM with **Least Privilege Principle**

**Stack:**
- Python, Pandas  
- AWS Lambda, SQS, DynamoDB  
- Pytest, unittest.mock  
- IAM, Environment Variables
